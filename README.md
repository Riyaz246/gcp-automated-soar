# Automated GCP SOAR Pipeline for Leaked Keys

This project is an automated SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) pipeline built 100% on Google Cloud. It automatically detects and revokes a leaked GCP service account key in real-time.

This is a portfolio project demonstrating skills in Cloud Security, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and Serverless Security Automation.

## üöÄ Features
* **Event-Driven:** Uses Pub/Sub to trigger a Cloud Function.
* **Automated Remediation:** The function automatically revokes the leaked key using the IAM API.
* **Secure Audit Trail:** Logs every revocation action to BigQuery for compliance and incident tracking.
* **Infrastructure as Code:** All cloud resources (Pub/Sub, BigQuery, Cloud Function, IAM roles) are defined and managed by Terraform.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
* **Cloud:** Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
* **IaC:** Terraform
* **Compute:** Cloud Functions (Python)
* **Messaging:** Pub/Sub
* **Data/Logging:** BigQuery

## üì∏ Project Showcase (The Full Lifecycle)

This project was built, tested, and decommissioned following professional IaC and SecOps practices.

### 1. The Plan (`terraform plan`)
Defines the 9 cloud resources to be built as code.

### 4. The Proof: Audit Trail (The "Logging")
The "SUCCESS_DISABLED" log is written to BigQuery for compliance.
